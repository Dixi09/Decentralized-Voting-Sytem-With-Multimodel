# SecureVote Chain - Decentralized Voting System with Facial Recognition

A complete decentralized voting system that combines blockchain technology with facial recognition for secure and transparent elections.

## Project Overview

SecureVote Chain is a project that implements a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system using blockchain technology and biometric verification. The system provides:

- Facial recognition for voter authentication
- Two-factor authentication with OTP
- Blockchain-based vote storage and verification
- Real-time result tracking and analytics

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Ethers.js for blockchain integration

### Backend (Proposed)
- Python with Flask for API endpoints
- OpenCV and dlib for facial recognition
- Web3.py for Ethereum blockchain interaction

### Blockchain
- Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- IPFS for decentralized storage

## Features

1. **Secure User Registration**
   - Personal information collection
   - Facial biometric registration
   - Identity verification

2. **Multi-factor Authentication**
   - Facial recognition verification
   - One-time password (OTP) verification

3. **Secure Voting Process**
   - Election selection
   - Candidate voting
   - Blockchain transaction recording

4. **Transparent Results**
   - Real-time vote counting
   - Multiple visualization options
   - Blockchain verification

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Development Environment
- Install VS Code and required extensions
- Set up Node.js and npm
- Install Python and required libraries for backend

### 2. Frontend Development
- Create React application with TypeScript
- Implement UI components using Tailwind CSS
- Set up routing for different pages
- Implement facial recognition with webcam integration

### 3. Backend Development
- Set up Python Flask server
- Implement facial recognition algorithms
- Create API endpoints for user registration and verification
- Set up OTP generation and verification

### 4. Blockchain Integration
- Develop Ethereum smart contracts for voting
- Set up Web3 connection for blockchain interaction
- Implement vote recording and verification

### 5. Testing
- Test facial recognition accuracy
- Verify blockchain integration
- Perform security testing
- Conduct user acceptance testing

### 6. Deployment
- Deploy frontend to web hosting
- Deploy backend to server
- Deploy smart contracts to Ethereum network

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ and npm
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- Ethereum wallet (for blockchain interaction)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to project directory
cd secure-vote-chain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup (Proposed)
```bash
# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask opencv-python dlib face_recognition numpy web3

# Run Flask server
python app.py
```

## Security Considerations

- All facial biometric data should be encrypted
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Use liveness detection to prevent photo-based attacks
- Store private keys securely

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile application integration
- Support for multiple election types
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with government ID verification
- Improved accessibility features
