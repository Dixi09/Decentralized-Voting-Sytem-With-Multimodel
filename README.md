# SecureVote Chain - Decentralized Voting System with Multimodel Biometric Verification

A complete decentralized voting system that combines blockchain technology with facial recognition, palm verification, and OTP for secure and transparent elections.

## Project Overview

SecureVote Chain is a project that implements a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system using blockchain technology and multimodel biometric verification. The system provides:

- Facial recognition for voter authentication
- Palm recognition for additional identity verification (now with faster processing)
- Two-factor authentication with OTP
- Blockchain-based vote storage and verification
- Real-time result tracking and analytics
- Tamper-proof voting records
- Parallel processing of votes for enhanced performance

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Ethers.js for blockchain integration
- TensorFlow.js for client-side face/palm recognition

### Backend
- Supabase for database and authentication
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Realtime subscriptions for live updates

### Blockchain
- Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- IPFS for decentralized storage
- Transaction verification and validation

## Features

1. **Multi-factor Biometric Authentication**
   - Facial recognition verification (liveness detection)
   - Optimized palm recognition verification (faster processing)
   - One-time password (OTP) verification

2. **Secure User Registration**
   - Personal information collection
   - Biometric registration (face and palm)
   - Identity verification and validation

3. **Secure Voting Process**
   - Election selection with filtering options
   - Candidate voting with detailed information
   - Parallel blockchain and database transaction recording
   - Vote confirmation and receipt generation

4. **Transparent Results**
   - Real-time vote counting and updates
   - Multiple visualization options (charts, graphs)
   - Blockchain verification of all votes
   - Audit trail for election integrity

5. **Secure Data Management**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Distributed storage of voting data
   - Immutable vote records
   - Privacy preservation

6. **Administrative Tools**
   - Election creation and management
   - Candidate registration
   - Voter eligibility verification
   - Result certification

## Security Features

1. **Tamper-Proof Storage**
   - All votes are stored on a decentralized blockchain
   - Immutable records provide transparency and auditability
   - Cryptographic protection of all voting data

2. **Advanced Biometric Verification**
   - Multi-factor biometric authentication (face + palm)
   - Liveness detection to prevent spoofing
   - Secure storage of biometric templates

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions system
   - Secure authentication for all actions
   - Time-limited access tokens

4. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Complete audit trail of all voting activities
   - Real-time monitoring of system health
   - Automated alerts for suspicious activities

## Performance Features
   - Parallel processing for blockchain and database operations
   - Optimized palm verification for faster authentication
   - Real-time vote counting updates
   - Efficient database queries and caching
